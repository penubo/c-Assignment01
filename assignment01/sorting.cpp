/*
 * exchange sort
 *
 * exchange sort is executed by comparing between one pivot (from left) with last nodes.
 * for example below is the very first iteration of exchange sort.
 *
 *  O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O           (p) : pivot
 * (p) (c)
 *  O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O           (c) : current
 * (p)     (c)
 *  O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O   O
 * (p)          . . . . . . . . . . . .(c)
 *
 * if current is smaller than pivot during this iteration exchange pivot to current.
 *
 * After each iteration, it decides the smallest node at position of the pivot and
 * move the pivot to the right. do iteration until the pivot get to the tail.
 *
 * exchange sort sorts the list in ascending order.
 *
 * {@code} node_pivoted
 * the pivot node starts from head of the list. After each iteration, pivot will be
 * the smallest node among the list except nodes already decided by previous iteration.
 *
 * {@code} node_current
 * the current node is the very node to be examined to find smaller node than pivot.

 * Helper function for merge_sort
 *
 * merge two lists, which is supposed to be sorted already, to an one list.

 * Each comparation of nodes in two lists, set the smaller node in original list.
 * If the node, weather left or right, gets to the end of copied list, set nodes in
 * left side to original list. Note here we don't need to care for nodes in the right
 * since they are already in right position no matter we compared them or not. We have
 * to care, However, nodes in left because positions doesn't fit into original list.
 *
 * Note that {@code} index_from is inclusive whereas {@code} index_to is exclusive.
 *
 * {@code} node_left
 * reference of a node in the left list which already sorted and also copied.
 *
 * {@code} node_right
 * reference of a node in the right list which already sorted and also copied.
 *
 * {@code} node_pivoted
 * reference of a node which will be set into the original list after every iteration.
 *
 * {@code} list_current_index
 * index of the original list which is being sorted. Basically, we rearrange every node
 * in original list from {@code} index_from to {@code} index_to.
